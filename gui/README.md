# Aiptasia GUI Notes

## TODO
- Find out why image requires a user action to show up instead of showing when app opens
- Set max panning such that image is always somewhat in frame
- Check if we need to load the PIL image in both the main app class and user action class (seems to be waste of memory)
- Create ability to put points on image pixels that align with user actions (pan, zoom, etc.)
-
